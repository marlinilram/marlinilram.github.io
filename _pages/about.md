Lin's work mainly lies in geometry processing, rendering, 3D modeling and reconstructions. Recently, with explosion in NeRF-based method and its promising performance to capture/render reality, he has strong believes that [NGP (neural graphics primitive)](https://github.com/OpenNGP/OpenNGP) will shine as a first-class datatype in the next-gen CG platform.
